Naam Tamilar RTMP Server

This project updated as open source for future use of Naam Tamilar Political Party.
To contribute to the party and in some case if there is any possibilities if i cannot support them for long term.
I thought of sharing this source code so in future it may be helpful for the community and party in which other software developers can help them to upgrade.

This source is forked from - https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module
and modified with multiple broadcast option.

Stream Sources will be able to restreamed to RTMP Player, Youtube API, Facebook API, Twitch and any other plaftforms that supports streaming with API and stream key.
